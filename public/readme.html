<h1>Joshua Toyota's Care Cloud Assignment</h1>

<h2>Responses</h2>

<p>With the exception of the List action, the API response with JSON in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "status": "(success|error)",
  "message": "&lt;success_message|error_messages&gt;"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Successful messages have a Response Code of 200.</p>

<p>Error messages have a response code of 400 (Bad Request).</p>

<h2>Worth Mentioning</h2>

<p>In the sample dataset, some of the start and end times overlap.  As a result,
when loading the seed data incrementally, any subsequent appointments with
overlapping times were not created as per the conditions.</p>

<h2>Web Framework: Rails</h2>

<p>I chose Rails for this assignment only because of time constraints.  Under
normal circumstances, I would have chosen Sinatra for implementing a (JSON)
REST API.  For such a small project, the robustness of Rails isn't necessary.
Due to the robustness, Rails also adds unnecessary overhead increasing
loadtimes.</p>

<h2>Testing Framework: Minitest</h2>

<p>I have used RSpec for many years now.  However, because Minitest is the new
standard for Rails 4 and the DSL is almost identical to RSpec's, it wasn't a
problem making the transition.</p>

<p>Also, the test written were integration/functional tests.  Because the
underlying business logic was sparce and implementing the rules were best done
by utilizing Rails' features, I avoided extracting the rules into separate libs
and concerns.  For a larger app, I generally follow an 80/20 unit/integration
test percentage.</p>
